# UserLogic

This is the top-level of the OPS-SAT Swansea Hardware Abstraction Layer (OSS-HAL). 
Here you can add your OPS-SAT FPGA logic that is deployable on the satellite and local test setup.

### Top-level

The top-level of the shell is the oss_hal module that is contained in oss_hal.sv. Here we can find a standard interface to access the rest of the OPS-SAT system and interact with the hardware from software.
